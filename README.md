Have you ever wanted 3D items? Well now you have it, this texture adds 3D items such as lanterns, torches and campfires, soon even more 3D items such as totem, sea cucumber ect ect will be added

And it may also be compatible with some of your textures, and well, you wonder how I can make the texture of the flashlight compatible with my texture?

-well you see the images that are below, those you will have to redesign and put the design of your texture, to achieve the transparent effect just make the pixels are half transparent but still show, and when you finish doing that you can have your lantern or torch or campfire as your texture, although good if you are going to distribute it or make a version that now your texture can be joined with this texture, put credits from the creator i mean i
